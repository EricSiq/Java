Course Outline

 Part1: Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to
implement these input methods in java (command line args, Scanner,
BufferedReader, DataInputStream, Console )

Part2: Implement a simple menu driven calculator in java to implement
add, sub, mul, div, sqrt, power, mean, variance. Implement a separate
Calculator class to include all related function inside that class. (mean
calculation : program reads numbers from the keyboard, summing them

in the process until the user enters the string “end”. It then stops input
& displays the avg. of numbers)
Part1: W.a.p that declares two arrays named ‘even’ and ‘odd’. Accept
numbers from the user and move them to respective arrays depending
on whether they are even or odd.
Part2: Implement a java function that finds 2 neighboring numbers in
an array with the smallest distance to each. The function should return
the index of the 1st number.
Part 3: Write a Java program to convert an array into ArrayList and vice
versa.

3. Write a menu-driven Java Program to study the concepts of classes,
array of objects, instance members, constructors in java.
Assignment description: Create a Student class describing attributes of
a student like prn, name, DoB, marks etc. Create an array of objects of
Student class and perform operations like: Add students, Display, Search
(by prn, by name, by position), Update/Edit and Delete.

4.Write a menu-driven Java Program for the following: There are 52 cards
in a deck, each of which belongs to one of four suits and one of 13 ranks.
Represent a deck of cards as an array of Objects

5. Implement the generic Shapes class as an interface s so that we can
implement concrete classes like circle, triangle, rectangle class from it.
1) Write an abstract class Shape
– Protected Data members: dim1, dim2, dim3, numSides
– Constructor: initialize numSides and dimensions, zero and
parameterized constructors
– Concrete method: getmethod for numSides
– Abstract methods: getArea(), getPerimeter()
2) Write a concrete subclass Rectangle
– Protected Data members: dim1, dim2,
3) Write a concrete subclass RtTriangle
– Protected Data members: dim1, dim2,
4) Write a concrete subclass Circle
– Protected Data members: dim1, dim2,
5) In another class, write a main method to define a Rectangle and a
Triangle and Circle using concepts of Dynamic method Dispatch
