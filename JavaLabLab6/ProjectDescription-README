# Duck Simulation System 🦆  

## Overview  
This project implements a **Duck Simulation System** using the **Strategy Design Pattern**. It allows different types of ducks to have unique behaviors for **flying, quacking, and swimming**, which can be dynamically assigned and changed at runtime.  

## Features  
- **Encapsulation of Behaviors**: Ducks have separate behavior classes for flying, quacking, and swimming.  
- **Flexible & Extensible**: New duck types or behaviors can be easily added.  
- **Realistic Simulation**: Different ducks exhibit different behaviors.  

## Class Structure  

### `Duck` (Abstract Class)  
- Defines a blueprint for all ducks.  
- Holds references to `FlyBehavior`, `QuackBehavior`, and `SwimBehavior`.  

### `DecoyDuck` (Concrete Class)  
- A type of duck that **does not fly, does not quack, and drowns**.  
- Uses `NoFly`, `MuteQuack`, and `Swim(Swim.SwimType.DROWN)`.  

### `FlyBehavior` (Interface)  
- Implemented by `FlyWithWings` and `NoFly`.  

### `QuackBehavior` (Interface)  
- Implemented by `Quack` and `MuteQuack`.  

### `SwimBehavior` (Interface)  
- Implemented by `Swim`, which uses an enum (`SWIM, FLOAT, DROWN`).
