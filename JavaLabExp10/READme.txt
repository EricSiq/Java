JavaLabExp10
a simple multi-file Java application that demonstrates the use of threads in an everyday scenario. In this example, one thread simulates a printing task (for instance, printing status messages) while another performs a simple calculation task. Each operation is encapsulated in its own Java file, and every logical block is accompanied by comments as per coding guidelines.
