Menu Driven Shape Calculator
This project is a Java-based menu-driven application designed to calculate the area, perimeter, and volume of various 2D and 3D shapes. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, and encapsulation.

Features
2D Shapes:

Circle: Calculates area and perimeter.
Rectangle: Calculates area and perimeter.
Square: Calculates area and perimeter.
3D Shapes:

Sphere: Calculates surface area and volume.
Cylinder: Calculates surface area, base perimeter, and volume.
Equilateral Pyramid (Square Base): Calculates surface area (base + lateral area), base perimeter, and volume.
Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple Java files, each responsible for a specific class or interface:

Shape.java:
An abstract class that defines common properties and methods (including a non-abstract constructor) for all shapes. It declares abstract methods for calculating area and perimeter.

Volume.java:
An interface for 3D shapes that declares the calculateVolume() method.

Circle.java:
Extends Shape and implements the calculations for a circle.

Rectangle.java:
Extends Shape and implements the calculations for a rectangle.

Square.java:
Extends Shape and implements the calculations for a square.

Sphere.java:
Extends Shape and implements Volume to provide calculations for a sphere.

Cylinder.java:
Extends Shape and implements Volume to provide calculations for a cylinder.

EquilateralPyramid.java:
Extends Shape and implements Volume to provide calculations for an equilateral pyramid (square base).

Menu.java:
Contains the main method. It presents a menu to the user to select a shape, gathers the necessary measurements via user input, and then displays the computed area, perimeter, and volume (if applicable).
